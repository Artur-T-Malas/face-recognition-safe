### This is a repository containing the source code for the GUI application for operating and managing the database for my Facial Recognition Safe.

Author: **Artur T. Małas**

This software was a part of my Bachelor of Engineering thesis "*Development of an automatic device for issuing keys*" at Łódź University of Technology in 2023. 

Because of that, most of the names in the code are in polish.

This application was designed to work on a Raspberry Pi with a webcam and a touchscreen (or keyboard with mouse) connected to a multi-compartment safe.
