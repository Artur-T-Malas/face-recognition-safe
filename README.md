# Face-Recognition-Safe

### This is a repository containing the source code for the GUI application for operating and managing the database for my Facial Recognition Safe.

Author: **Artur T. Małas**

This software was a part of my Bachelor of Engineering thesis "*Development of an automatic device for issuing keys*" at Łódź University of Technology in 2023. 

Because of that, most of the names in the code are in polish.

This application was designed to work on a Raspberry Pi with a webcam and a touchscreen (or keyboard with mouse) connected to a multi-compartment safe.

The main inspiration for the face recognition part of this project was a tutorial ["Face recognition using OpenCV and Python: A beginner's guide"](https://www.superdatascience.com/blogs/opencv-face-recognition).

I would also like to thank [docPhil99](https://gist.github.com/docPhil99) for his tutorial ["How to display opencv video in pyqt apps"](https://gist.github.com/docPhil99/ca4da12c9d6f29b9cea137b617c7b8b1). It was crucial in making this program into a GUI.
